# Advanced Robotics Project
Autonomous Driving using AWS Deepracer robot. 
Implemented:
- Drive and stop when there is a wall within 1m.
- PID controllers for driving on rectangular track with alcoves. (Backs out of front collision)
- Reverse Driving. (Backs out of "front" collision)
- Grid-based SLAM with Monte-Carlo localization policy using particle filter ideas.
- Rudimentary user interface with relevant telemetry and odometry data.

See videos for better idea.
